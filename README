== XSS & UJS

Background:
  Another developer has started the process of switching the application from using the Prototype javascript library to using jQuery, unfortunately he didn't quite finish the project; so, we need you to finish the job.  After that, we need you to tackle an issue that our client has been asking for; he's heard all these great things about AJAX, and can't believe we aren't using it in his application.  So, we've decided that we'll start by adding some AJAX goodness to the cart.

Instructions:
  1.  Switch from Prototype library to jQuery

    a.  Remove the prototype javascript files

    b.  Move the jQuery files from the project root into the public/javascripts directory

    c.  Replace the rails.js file for prototype with the rails.js file for jquery, which is also in the project root

    d.  Modify the application layout file to include jquery.js, rails.js, and application.js (in that order); instead of the defaults

  2.  In order to use the new Rails AJAX helpers, you will need to add the CSRF meta tags to the application layout file, somewhere between <head> and </head>
      Code: <%= csrf_meta_tag %>

  3.  If you haven't yet, fire up your server, add an item to your cart, view your cart, and increase/decrease the quantity of an item in your cart using the arrows

  4.  You should have noticed that there are a couple of links on the cart page that are not quite working as we would like.  The links need markup inside the anchor tag, but we are using Rails' `link_to` helper to create the links and it is escaping our markup.  We need you to wrap the markup with a call to `raw`, the file to modify is app/views/cart/_cart_table.html.erb and you will find the problem links on lines 21 and 43

  5.  Modify the links in the /views/cart/_cart_table.html.erb that update the line item quantities to be AJAX, using the new link_to ajax syntax.  FYI, you do not need to touch the controller

  6.  Modify the delete from cart link to have a confirmation box.  "Are you sure you want to remove this item?"
